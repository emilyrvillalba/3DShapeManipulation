# 3DShapeManipulation
This project put all the knowledge from this semester together and tested our ability to
implement various JavaFX features. I formed a group with Tyler Morrison and Allison Chen,
and I took on the job of the format, adding shapes, input validation, and styling and final
finishing details. I also collaborated with both of my partners on their tasks because we needed to
make sure all of our separate parts work together. My main challenge was making sure the right
variables and objects were global so that every method had access to the parts they need to work.
Also, organizing and establishing a functioning outline of how we were going to code the
program and how it was going to look visually was daunting. At first I considered making a class
for each type of shape so that we could manipulate each shape’s characteristics easier. However,
after a lot of trial and error, I decided that creating an ArrayList with all of the shapes that the
user adds manually would ensure that every part of the program would have access to the
location and dimensions and of each shape. There were also multiple border panes, many
variables, and many methods that I tried to keep as orderly as possible while making sure the
program is user-friendly.
The most difficult part of our entire program was getting our saved files to import
correctly. The first thing that made this challenging is that the team member that worked on the
menu system, which included importing and saving files, worked individually, so we had a hard
time integrating that part into the rest of the program. We all got together to work on this part in
order to make sure the “save” EventHandler was using the Arraylist we created and grabbing the
right information to save onto our file. Then, the next challenge was importing the shapes and the
entire SubScene’s features correctly. Because our source code was so long, it was easy to make
silly mistakes such as forgetting to rename variables or accidentally changing a single line that
made our whole system fail. After many hours of collaboration, we managed to run a completed
program that works how we wanted it to.
